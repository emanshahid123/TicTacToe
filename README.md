📌 Project Title:
Tic-Tac-Toe AI with Minimax and Alpha-Beta Pruning

📋 Description:
This project implements a complete Tic-Tac-Toe game in Python where a human player can play against an AI opponent.
The AI uses the Minimax algorithm to make optimal moves and is further optimized with Alpha-Beta Pruning to improve efficiency.

🚀 Features:
Full Tic-Tac-Toe game playable on the console.

AI Player using Minimax to ensure the best possible moves.

Optimized AI using Alpha-Beta Pruning for faster decisions.
